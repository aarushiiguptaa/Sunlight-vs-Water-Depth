# Sunlight-vs-Water-Depth
This repository contains the research and data used to check the amount of light at different depths of a stream system because we were interested in the light availability and the impact this light has on the area. We wondered if the various amounts of light at different depths could affect aquatic vegetation. 
This project was completed through R and RStudio.
